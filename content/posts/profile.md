# About the Author ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Thanks for reading! I am a software engineer with a passion for data systems and supporting people in making use of data. I've worked in R&D science, manufacturing, and healthcare. I love learning new domains, but I still get the most satisfaction out of what got me into software engineering: the look on someone's face when you automate a part of their job that they hated doing or didn't know how to do.

In addition to software engineering I enjoy parenting, music, cooking, and the outdoors. This site is part portfolio, part personal notes, and just a way for me to share things I find exciting. The 'nightnoon' moniker comes from something I find myself at midnight needing to trivialize the hour so I can continue doing something exciting "I can stay up later doing this, it's only night noon". I hope some of the interests and passions I'm exploring here can send you down your own 'night noon' rabbit holes.
