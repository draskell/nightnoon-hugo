# Strategy for Deantown on Bass

Transcription: [Free Bass Transcriptions](https://freebasstranscriptions.com/transcriptions/vulfpeck-dean-town/)

## Chord Progression and Key

Looking at the transcription the chords are: F#m7 - C#m11 - E9 - B7. 

There are four sharps on the staff, which going clockwise around the circle of fifths from C (no sharps) → G (1#) → D (2#) → A (3#) → **E (4#)**, means E Major.

## Strategy

I found Deantown to be pretty hard to learn. It has several a fast, sustained 16th note runs strung together. Finding an efficient fingering can be a huge help when learning this song. Going from the sheet music you have to come up with your own strategy for playing the notes efficiently. My intent here is to lay out some of my thinking on the way to learning the song, but that's not to say the way I play is the most efficient for you.

If you're going from a tab, the person making the tab has made decisions about what string a note should be played on (if not exactly which finger). I've found that a lot of the tabs available have the right notes but a difficult strategy for playing it. 

The strategy to replicating the song is: 
1. Try to move your left hand as little as possible.
2. Move in small steps when necessary.
3. Move when there's a rare lull in pace of the song.

## Breakdown

### Opening 16th Notes

The song starts out with repeated sixteenth notes. This is the easy part of the song for the left hand which is our focus in this discussion. To get the 16th notes, there's no quick tricks. Start slow playing 16th notes with alternating fingers with a metronome. Work up the pace until you can match the song. Focus on getting it clean slow first then slowly bring up the speed. It's bad practice to set the speed higher than you can cleanly muster and play sloppy. 

Keep the alternation consistent even when switching strings. The index is always on the 1. 

### 1st F#m

Coming out of the preceding B7 16th note run there are two leading notes on the &-a of the 4th beat.
