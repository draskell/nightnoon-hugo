# Strategy for Deantown on Bass

## Getting Started

I found Deantown to be pretty hard to learn, it's a fast, sustained 16th note run. Finding an efficient fingering can be huge when learning this song. There's a great transcription on [Free Bass Transcriptions](https://freebasstranscriptions.com/transcriptions/vulfpeck-dean-town/). Going from the sheet music you have to come up with your own strategy for playing the notes. Depending on the person you may have your own best strategy. My intent here is to lay out some of my thinking on the way to learning the song, but that's not to say the way I play is the most efficient for you.

If you're going from a tab, the person making the tab has made decisions about what string a note should be played on (if not exactly which finger). I've found that a lot of the tabs available have the right notes but a difficult strategy for playing it. The key to replicating the speedy line is to try to move your left hand as little as possible, in small steps when necessary, and ideally when there's a rare lull in the song. Each time you move your left hand you are in a new "position".

## Chord Progression and Key

Looking at the transcription the chords are: F#m7 - C#m11 - E9 - B7. There are five sharps on the staff, which going clockwise around the circle of fifths from C (no sharps) → G (1#) → D (2#) → A (3#) → E (4#) → **B (5#)**, means B Major.
