A baby was born the size of an egg with no arms and no legs. ...the mother and father go to a local witch (maybe really effeminate witch man). He asks that they give some part of their body to make arms and legs. Little by little the parents give up more and more of their bodies until the witch man has used their entire bodies to create a a young man from them. The witch man then takes the teenager in and exploits him. Queue analogy to the way capitalism exploits the working poor without inheritance from their families.
