# Technical Utility Bookmarks

These are some utility pages I keep bookmarked as technical references when developing. I'm going to treat this like an Awesome List, so it will be a work in progress as I add more bookmarks.

## Crontab Guru

The crontab guru takes the guesswork out of crontab schedules: [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste in an existing schedule you are debugging or check out the example page for suggestions that might be useful for a new schedule.

## Regex 101

A great sandbox for evaluating regular expressions: [regex101](https://regex101.com). I reach for this tool whenever I need to develop a new regular expression.  

## SQL Online IDE

The SQL online IDE is a simple interface over a couple of common dialects: [SQL online IDE](https://sqliteonline.com). You're not going to use it to build a DB, but it can be useful when working HackerRank SQL problems or prototyping data models.

## Mockaroo

A tool for making simple mock data sets. I haven't tested out the login features, but the basic functionality is really useful.

## Neetcode.io

Great resource for preparing for software developer interviews.
